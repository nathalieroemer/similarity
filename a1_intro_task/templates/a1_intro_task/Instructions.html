        This task consists of 18 rounds. In each round, you will have to choose between two illustrations provided by two different creators.
        The creators are workers from another task who were asked to illustrate words
        (e.g., objects, items or actions) using a fixed set of materials.
    </p>
<!--
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Original</b>:
            The word is <b>not</b> among a random set of 50 illustrated words from a similar task.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Recognizable</b>:
            People can <b>recognize the illustrated word</b> when they see the illustration.
        </li>
    </ol>
!-->
    <p>
        It is your goal to <b> choose the illustrations with the highest value</b>.
        The value of an illustration is determined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Value of illustration = 0</b> if it <b>is not original</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
             An illustration is <b>original</b> if the illustrated word is <b>not</b> among a set of 50 words that creators illustrated in a similar task.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Value of illustration = recognition rate</b> (from 0 to 100)
            if it <b>is original</b>
        </li>
         <ul>
            <li>
            The <b>recognition rate</b> is the fraction of people (from 0-100%) that recognize the word when they see the illustration only.
            </li>
         </ul>
    </ul>
