    <p>
        Next, you will see 50 consecutive illustrations on your screen.
        These illustrations were created by workers in a prior task.
        These workers' task was to  illustrate words, such as objects, items or actions with a provided set of elements.
        The words could be chosen freely and had to consist of <b> only one </b> (British English) word.
    </p>
    <p> <b>
        Your task is to identify the illustrated words.</b>
        In order to receive payment for an illustration, you must enter the <b> exact word </b>
        that the other worker assigned to that illustration. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that the words were illustrated by different workers.
        This means that it is possible to see more than one illustration of the same word.
    </p>

        <b><u>Payment</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will receive your payment only if you complete the entire task. You receive <b>$0.30</b> for
        participating in the task. In addition, you receive <b>$0.10</b> for each illustration that you correctly identify.
