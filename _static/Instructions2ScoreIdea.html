                <p>
        This task consists of 18 rounds. In each round, you will have to choose between two illustrations provided by two different creators.
        The creators are workers from another task who were asked to illustrate words
        (e.g., objects, items or actions) using a fixed set of materials.
    </p>
<!--
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Original</b>:
            The word is <b>not</b> among a random set of 50 illustrated words from a similar task.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Recognizable</b>:
            People can <b>recognize the illustrated word</b> when they see the illustration.
        </li>
    </ol>
!-->
    <p>
        It is your goal to <b> choose the illustrations with the highest value</b>.
        The value of an illustration is determined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Value of illustration = 0</b> if it <b>is not original</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
             An illustration is <b>original</b> if it is <b>not</b> among a set of 50 words that creators illustrated in a similar task.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Value of illustration = recognition rate</b> (from 0 to 100)
            if it <b>is original</b>
        </li>
         <ul>
            <li>
            The <b>recognition rate</b> is the fraction of people (from 0-100%) that recognize the word when they see the illustration only.
            </li>
         </ul>
    </ul>



    <br>

    <p>
        <b> <u>Your bonus</u></b>
    </p>

    <p>
        To determine whether or not you receive the bonus,
        we will randomly choose one out of the 18 rounds after you completed the task.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you chose the illustration with the <b>higher value</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$1.50</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you chose the illustration with the <b>lower value</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$0</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If both illustrations have the <b>same value</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$0.75</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            In addition to the illustrations, you will be provided with an assessment of the originality and recognizability of the respective illustration by its
            creator.
            Participants know that this assessment may be shown to you
            and have an incentives to convince the reader that their illustration is of high value.
