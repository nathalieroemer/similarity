        This task consists of 20 rounds. In each round, you will have to choose between two workers. You choose a worker by clicking on the button, indicating the respective worker.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> <u>The workers</u></b>
    </p>

  <p>
      The workers were participating in another task in which they completed a test.
      On the test, they were asked to answer up to 20 questions from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB).
      Each question tested their aptitude in one of the following five categories:
      General Science, Arithmetic Reasoning, Math Knowledge, Mechanical Comprehension, and Assembling Objects.
      In addition to being used by the military to determine which jobs armed service members are qualified for,
      performance on the ASVAB is often used as a measure of cognitive ability by academic researchers.
  </p>

    <p>
        <b> <u>Your decision</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is your goal to <b> choose the worker with the higher performance on the test</b>.
        The workers' performance on the test is defined as the number of questions that he or she solved correctly.
    </p>


    <p>
        <b> <u>Your bonus</u></b>
    </p>

    <p>
        To determine whether or not you receive the bonus,
        we will randomly choose one out of the 20 rounds after you completed the task.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you chose the worker with the <b>higher performance</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$1.50</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you chose the worker with the <b>lower performance</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$0</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If both workers have the <b>same performance</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$0.75</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

           You will be provided with a description written by the workers in the respective round.
            Workers know that the description may be shown to you and have an incentive to
            convince you that they performed well on the test.
