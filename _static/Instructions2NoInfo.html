    <p>
        This task consists of 10 rounds. In each round, you will have to choose between two illustrations provided by two different creators. You choose an illustration by clicking on the button, indicating the respective illustration.
        If the creator of the illustration is <span style="color:#9400D3">female</span> this button is <span style="color:#9400D3">purple</span>.
        If the creator of the illustration is <span style="color:#00BFFF">male</span> this button is <span style="color:#00BFFF">blue</span>.
        The creators are workers from another task who were asked to illustrate words
        (e.g., objects, items or actions) using a fixed set of materials.
    </p>
<!--
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Original</b>:
            The word is <b>not</b> among a random set of 50 illustrated words from a similar task.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Recognizable</b>:
            People can <b>recognize the illustrated word</b> when they see the illustration.
        </li>
    </ol>
!-->
    <p>
        It is your goal to <b> choose the illustrations with the highest value</b>.
        The value of an illustration is determined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Value of illustration = 0</b> if it <b>is not original</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
             An illustration is <b>original</b> if <b>no other creator</b> among 50 randomly drawn creators in this task <b>illustrated the same word</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Value of illustration = recognition rate</b> (from 0 to 100)
            if it <b>is original</b>
        </li>
         <ul>
            <li>
            The <b>recognition rate</b> is the fraction of people (from 0-100%) that recognized the word when we asked them to guess the illustrated word based on the illustration only.
            </li>
         </ul>
    </ul>


    <br>

    <p>
        <b> <u>Your bonus</u></b>
    </p>

    <p>
        To determine whether or not you receive the bonus,
        we will randomly choose one out of the 10 rounds after you completed the task.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you chose the illustration with the <b>higher value</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$1.50</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you chose the illustration with the <b>lower value</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$0</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If both illustrations have the <b>same value</b> in the selected round, your bonus is <b>$0.75</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>
