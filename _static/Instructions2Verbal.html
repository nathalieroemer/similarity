            <p>
                This task consists of 15 rounds. In each round, you will have to choose between two illustrations.
                These illustrations were created by other participants who were asked to illustrate words
                (e.g., objects, items or actions) using a fixed set of materials.
                In doing so, they tried to create illustrations that are
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Original</b>:
                    The word is <b>not</b> among a random set of 100 illustrated words from a related previous task.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Recognizable</b>:
                    People can <b>recognize the illustrated word</b> when they see your illustration.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                It is your goal, to choose the illustrations with the highest value.
                The value of an illustration depends on whether it is original or not
                and on the recognition rate of the illustrated word. The value is determined as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Value of illustration = 0</b> if it <b>is not original</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Value of illustration = recognition rate</b> (from 0 to 100)
                    if it <b>is original</b>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p>
                <u>Your bonus</u>
            </p>

            <p>
                To determine whether or not you receive the bonus,
                we will randomly choose one out of the 15 rounds after you completed the task.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you chose the illustration with the higher value in the selected round, your bonus is £5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you chose the illustration with the lower value in the selected round, your bonus is £0.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The participants that created these illustrations in the other task are paid according to your decision.
                They receive a bonus if their illustration is chosen.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will be provided with a written promotion provided by the participants that created the illustrations.
                Participants know that this text may be shown to you and have an incentive to convince the reader
                that their illustration is of high value.
