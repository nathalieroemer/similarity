                In the following, you will be asked to <b>guess the performance</b> of workers in a prior task.
                These other workers answered <b>20 questions</b> on a <b>test from the Armed Service Vocational
                Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)</b>.
                Each question tested their aptitude in the following five categories:
                General Science, Arithmetic Reasoning, Math Knowledge, Mechanical Comprehension, and Assembling Objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing this test, participants were asked to describe their performance on the test.
                Workers had an incentive to provide favourable descriptions of their performance since their earnings depended
                on being perceived as high performers on the test.

            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you will see <b>40 descriptions</b> of the performance of these <b>workers from a previous task</b>
                on your screen. Based on the descriptions it is <b>your task to guess</b>:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>How many <b>questions</b> did <b>the worker get right</b> on the test</li>

                <b><u>Payment</u></b>

            <p>
                You will receive your payment only if you complete the entire task. You receive <b>$0.30</b> for
                participating in the task. In addition, you can receive a <b>bonus of up to $5.00</b> depending on the accuracy
                of your guess.
            </p>
            <p>
                To determine the bonus, we will randomly choose one out of the <b>40</b> rounds after you completed the task.

                <b><u>Number of correctly answered questions</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                For your prediction with respect to the number of correctly answered questions, payment depends on the
                deviation from the true number of correctly answered questions in the randomly determined round:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If your answer deviates by <b>1 or less</b> questions your <b>bonus is $4.00</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your answer deviates by <b>more than 1 and 2 or less</b> questions your <b>bonus is $2</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your answer deviates by <b>more than 2</b> your <b>bonus is $0</b>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b><u>Prediction of gender</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You have to guess the chance that the worker is female. Your guess will be used to determine your chances of
                winning the <b>bonus of 1$</b>. Your chance of winning the bonus is set so that more accurate guesses lead to a
                higher chance of winning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your guess is a percentage probability from 0 to 100 â€“ with 0 indicating a 0-out-of-100 chance that the gender
                of the worker is female and 100 indicating a 100-out-of-100 chance that the gender of the worker is female. The
                number you provide is called <i>Your Guess</i>. You choose <i>Your Guess</i> by clicking the response bar that
                will be shown on your screen. An example is displayed in figure 1. The width of the <b>red part</b> of the bar
                indicates <b>your guess that the worker is female</b>. The width of the <b>blue part</b> of the bar is 100 -
                <i>Your Guess</i> and represents <b>your guess that the worker is male</b>.
            </p>
